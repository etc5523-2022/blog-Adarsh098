### Data Description

 The data for this blog post is about various bird species counted by birdwatchers in Hamilton area of Ontario. Birdwatchers have counted birds they saw or heard in a day. Birds are counted every year around Christmas time, since 1921. The dataset is called **bird_counts.csv**. 
 
 This data has **six variables**, called **year**, **species** which has the species names in English, **species_latin** which has the species names in latin, **how_many_counted** contains the raw bird count, **total_hours** contains total hours spent counting, **how_many_counted_by_hour** describes the number of birds counted divided by total hours in that year.

The **source** of the data is from the tidytuesday [@rfordatascience] project on github.

The R packages used for this blog post are 
 tidyverse [@R-tidyverse], 
 plotly [@R-plotly]
 kableExtra [@R-kableExtra]
 DT [@R-DT]

  arrange(desc(`Birds Counted`)) 
```

```{r data2, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
data2 <- bird_counts %>% 
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarize(how_many_counted = sum(how_many_counted)) %>%
