### Data Description

 The data for this blog post is about various bird species counted by birdwatchers in Hamilton area of Ontario. Birdwatchers have counted birds they saw or heard in a day. Birds are counted every year around Christmas time, since 1921. The dataset is called **bird_counts.csv**. 
 
 This data has **six variables**, called **year**, **species** which has the species names in English, **species_latin** which has the species names in latin, **how_many_counted** contains the raw bird count, **total_hours** contains total hours spent counting, **how_many_counted_by_hour** describes the number of birds counted divided by total hours in that year.

The **source** of the data is from the tidytuesday [@rfordatascience] project on github.

The R packages used for this blog post are 
 tidyverse [@R-tidyverse], 
 plotly [@R-plotly]
 kableExtra [@R-kableExtra]
 DT [@R-DT]

### Why European starling was the most counted bird in Ontario during Christmas since 1921.

### Analysis

```{r table1, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
#| label: fig-table1
#| fig-cap: "Most Counted birds" 

datatable(data1, options = list(),
          caption = "Table 1: Most counted birds") %>% 
  formatStyle("Birds Counted", border = '1px solid #ddd',
  background = styleColorBar(data1$`Birds Counted`, "skyblue", -90)) %>% 
  formatRound("Birds Counted", digits = 0)
              
```


The data represents numerous birds counted, although most birds counted are on a similar frequency. The aggregate numbers of bird count shows only one species with a very high count. From the @fig-table1, the most counted bird is **European Starling**, but the rest of the birds have a lower frequency of count.


As per Robert Alison [@alison_2009], "the European Starling is not a native bird species, they were introduced into North America in 1850, when 100 starlings were released by the Acclimation society of North America in an attempt to establish all birds mentioned in Shakespeare's plays".


```{r plot1, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
#| label: fig-plot1
#| fig-cap: "Total Birds Counted in each year since 1921"
p1 <- ggplot(data2,
           aes(x = year,
               y = `Birds Counted`)) +
      geom_point() +
      geom_line() +
      theme_bw() +
      theme(text = element_text(size = 12)) +
      labs(x = "Year",
           y = "Bird Count",
           title = "Total Birds Counted in each year since 1921")

ggplotly(p1)
```

As per the @fig-plot1, there are only few birds counted until year 1939, after which the aggregate bird count fluctuates but rises steadily. There was high concentration of birds from 1975 to 2005.


```{r plot2, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
#| label: fig-plot2
#| fig-cap: "Total European Starlings counted in each year since 1921"
bird_counts2 <- bird_counts %>% 
  filter(species == "European Starling") %>% 
  rename("Birds counted" = how_many_counted)
p2 <-  ggplot(bird_counts2,
             aes(x = year,
                 y = `Birds counted`)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line(col = "steelblue") +
  theme_bw() +
      theme(text = element_text(size = 12)) +
      labs(x = "Year",
           y = "Bird Count",
           title = "Total European Starlings counted in each year")

ggplotly(p2)
```


European Starlings were the dominant bird species in Ontario. The trend of total birds counted was at its peak between 1975 and 2005. It is a similar trend of European starling's which indicates that Starlings were counted on a higher frequency than most of the others bird species during that period.

European starlings were not counted in large numbers until late 1960's, see @fig-plot2. The most European starlings were found in 1980 but afterwards their numbers continued to decline. Robert Alison [@alison_2009] says that Starlings regularly nest in tree cavities which are used by native North American birds and that such behavior can be disruptive to the nesting activities of other birds, this could be another reason for the high count of starlings in Ontario.

The starlings numbers have consistently declined since 1992 @fig-plot2, according to Robert Alison[@alison_2009], it could be due to pesticides and the impact of ecosystem damage on wildlife.
